Hi, I am Youshua. I am doing my PhD at University Paris 8 under the supervision of Stefano Morra, Johannes Anschütz and Arthur-César Le Bras. Currently I am interested in using the theory of analytic stacks to study objects in the putative categorical p-adic Langlands program,

Recently I thought a bit about categorical Künneth formulas for general 6-functor formalisms: Categorical Künneth formulas for analytic stacks (pre-Arxivversion)
